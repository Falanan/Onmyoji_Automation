 # Introduction

 ## Reasons for developing scripts

 After a semester of computer vision madness, I suddenly started to find computer vision very interesting, and this time it was the "化四季" activity. So I thought, "Why don't we study a script that can automate the completion of the copy to get the scrolls? So I can easily to get top 10 position on the tanking to get 60 pieces of "Shiki".

 For people like me who can't summon a new character every time, I always want to be able to spell out a complete new character during the event. But this stuff requires basically playing the game 24 hours a day, and as a third-year student, I barely have time to play the game. In the introduction also said, in this script used the knowledge of computer vision, on this course, Lab writing a week can not finish writing, to the last Lab even wrote until 4:00 am can not finish writing, where I have time to play games? QAQ

 ## Technology used in this script

 Computer Vishion, Numpy, Mathplotlib.pyplot

## Running Environment
 
### Tested good on:

#### Macos (Apple silicon):

For Macos, I haven't tested about mouse moving part, and win32api library also not working on Macos. I only using Mac environment for developing the computer vision and optimizing algorithm.

- Macos Monterey 12.6, Conda python 3.7.13 environment

#### Windows (AMD-64)

- Windows 10 21H2, conda Python 3.9.13 environment
