 # Introduction

 ### Reasons for developing scripts

 After a semester of computer vision madness, I suddenly started to find computer vision very interesting, and this time it was the "化四季" activity. So I thought, "Why don't we study a script that can automate the completion of the copy to get the scrolls? So I can easily to get top 10 position on the tanking to get 60 pieces of "Shiki".

 For people like me who can't summon a new character every time, I always want to be able to spell out a complete new character during the event. But this stuff requires basically playing the game 24 hours a day, and as a third-year student, I barely have time to play the game. In the introduction also said, in this script used the knowledge of computer vision, on this course, Lab writing a week can not finish writing, to the last Lab even wrote until 4:00 am can not finish writing, where I have time to play games?
